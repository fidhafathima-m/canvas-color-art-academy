          <h2>About Canvas & Color Art Academy - Kannur's Leading Art Institute</h2>
          <p>We opened our doors in 2005 because we believe every child has an artist inside them. Our studio in Kannur is a space where kids aged 5 to 16 can explore paints, pencils, and clay without worrying about making mistakes.</p>

          <h3>Why Choose Our Art Academy in Kannur?</h3>

          <div class="feature-box">
            <h4>Drawing & Painting Classes in Kannur</h4>
            <p>We teach the basics - how to hold a brush, mix colors, understand light and shadow. Kids start with simple exercises and gradually work up to creating their own pieces.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-box">
            <h4>Building Confidence & Focus</h4>
            <p>When a child finishes a drawing they're proud of, something clicks. They realize they can create something from nothing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-box">
            <h4>Creative Thinking & Problem Solving</h4>
            <p>Art pushes kids to think outside the box. How do you show movement in a still image? What happens when you mix these two colors?</p>
